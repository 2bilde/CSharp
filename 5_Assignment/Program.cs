//Create a CarDealer program
//The CarDealer must have a list of available cars for sale
//The CarDealer must have public Buy/Sell methods
//These methods must change the car dealers available cars
//Make use of atleast 3 classes.
//Remeber, Classes are usually nouns (navneord, en/et foran), f.x.:
//Car, CarDealer, Engine
//Where as methods usually describes verbs (udsagnsord, at/jeg foran)
//Buy, Sell, Accelerate, Move

/*
I suggest the below approach for user interaction in the console
while(true){

    Console.WriteLine("Write an action [buy, sell, exit]");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();

    switch (input)
    {
        case "buy":
            break;
        case "sell":
            break;
        case "exit":
            return;
        default:
            return;
    }
}
